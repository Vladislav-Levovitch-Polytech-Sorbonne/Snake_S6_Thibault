 * - gameType: (string, max 150 char) type of the game we want to play (empty string for regular game)
 * - gameName: (string, max 50 char), corresponds to the game name (filled by the server)
 * - sizeX, sizeY: (int*) pointers to the dimension of the game (filled by the server)
 * - nbWalls: (int*) pointer to the number of walls
 *
* gameType is a string like "GAME key1=value1 key2=value1 ..."
 * - It indicates the type of the game you want to plys
 *   it could be "TRAINING <BOT>" to play against bot <BOT>
 *   or "TOURNAMENT xxxx" to join the tournament xxxx
 *   or "" (empty string) to wait for an opponent (decided by the server)
 * - key=value pairs are used for options (each training player has its own options)
 *   invalid keys are ignored, invalid values leads to error
 *   the following options are common to every training player
  *        - 'timeout': allows and define the timeout when training (in seconds)
 *        - 'seed': allows to set the seed of the random generator
 *        - 'start': allows to set who starts (0 or 1)
 *        - 'difficulty': between 0 (no walls) and 3 (a lot of walls); 2 is the default value
 *
 * The bots <BOT> available are :
 * - "RANDOM_PLAYER": player that makes random (but legal) moves
 * - "SUPER_PLAYER": not so good player, but maybe a little bit better than RANDOM_PLAYER...
